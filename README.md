# Excel-Dashboard
Background: An Excel dashboard is a visual representation of key metrics that allow company managers to quickly view and analyze their data in one place. Dashboards not only provide consolidated data views, but a self-service business intelligence opportunity, where users are able to filter the data to display just whatâ€™s important to them.

I designed an interactive Excel Dashboard by utilizing Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts. This dashboard showcases the sales of a company and is able to filter sales by region, employee and also by item share and customer revenue.
